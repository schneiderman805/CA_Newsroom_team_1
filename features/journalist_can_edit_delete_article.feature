Feature: Edit/delete articles
  As a Journalist,
  In order to change articles I have already written
  I would like to be able to edit & delete articles

  Background:
    Given the following user exists
      | first_name | last_name | email         | password | role       |
      | Hanna      | Nyman     | hanna@tuna.se | password | journalist |

    And the following categories exists
      | name     |
      | Sports   |
      | Politics |

    And the following articles exists
      | title                | lede                   | user_id | category_id |
      | A breaking news item | hello this is about me | Hanna   | Sports      |


    And I am logged in as "hanna@tuna.se"
    And I click "My account"
    Then I should see "A breaking news item"

  Scenario: Successfully edit an article
